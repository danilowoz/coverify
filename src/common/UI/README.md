`src/common/UI`

This folder should contain our "Primitives".

The common/UI folder **must never include any business logic or import from outside**.  
It should be self-contained and theoretically could be moved to another project and still work.  
Your should think of primitives as replacement for native DOM elements, only with some style attached.

It's this project's UI library.
